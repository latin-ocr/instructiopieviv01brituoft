FOREWORD

The principle followed in editing these two texts has been
to show the actual reading of the MSS. even where in some
cases it has been found necessary to alter or emend, in order to
give an intelligible meaning. In the matter of orthographyâ€š
the inconsistencies of the scribe are shown as in the original
text.

The appended glossary is brief simply because, the language
in general being that in ordinary use, only occasionally have
terms been used that require special elucidation. In certain
obscure instances the equivalent found in the Latin MS. has
been added, in order to show what the translator thought to
be the Latin that corresponded to his Gaelic word.

Warmest thanks are due in the first instance to Dr. Robin
Flower of the MSS. Dept. in the British Museum for pointing

, out the Latin and Irish manuscripts and for generously putting

the resources of the Museurn at my disposal 1 also to the friends
who by their suggestions, corrections and reading of proofs,
have rendered valuable assistance.

JOHN MACKECHNIE.
